       <h3 class ="title"> What is AI ?</h3>
       <p>
         First of all. <strong> AI </strong> stands for <em> Artificial intelligence</em>, and is just a fancy way to say <em> Intelligence created by humans </em>.
       </p>
       <p> To understand <em> AI </em> we need to understand that when we talk about intelligence we talk about the abillity of <strong> gathering </strong>, <strong> processing </strong> and then <strong> applying </strong> knowledge, respectively.</p>
       <h3 class="post-small-title"> Truth is... </h3>
       <p> ... there are different types of AI, all varying in their level of intelligence! <br>
        If we take a closer look, we can see that AI is all around us, just not as intelligent as science-fiction stories portray it to be.
       </p>
       <h3 class="post-small-title"> Different types you said? </h3>
       <p> YES. As I 've mentioned, there are different types of AI. 
        <br>
        The most basic form of AI is <strong> ANI </strong>, or <strong> Artificial Narrow Intelligence </strong> - it's called <em> Narrow </em> because it can only perform tasks in specific,
        predifined <strong> context </strong>. <br>
        Narrow AI can do a task it was programmed to incredibly well, but... and here's the catch...
        when you present a task that wasn't predefined and programmed, the <em> AI </em> get's confused, hence the name <strong> Narrow </strong>.</p>
        <p>If you want to discover more types of AI go to "Types of AI" or click <a href="about.html"> here
