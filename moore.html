       <p>
        The path toward super intelligence will probably be a way shorter than the one from <br>
        narrow to general intelligence.

         One of the first steps necessary to advance in AI technology is <strong>improve computational power</strong>. <br>
         Luckily, the computational power of hardware is accelerating at a steady rate. <br> 
         It's so steady that it's even raised a theory known as <strong> Moore's Law</strong>. The law says that <em>computational power doubles every two years</em>. This law has been accurate so far!
       </p>
       <p> 
         The next step is <strong>improving software</strong>. One of the main ways of doing that is by mimicking the brain through <strong> neutral networks</strong>.
       </p>
       <h3 class="post-small-title"> Neutral Networks </h3>
       <p>
         Neurons <em> active </em> <strong> Input </strong> to <strong> Output</strong>.
         Neural networks can be complicated, but there is a simplified version: They split information into a lot of smaller pieces.
       </p>

       <p>
         When we get <em> input </em> in the first column, we then compare it to the neuron in the next column and the next column after that. <br>
         We do this until we get to the <em> output </em> layer and fint the best match. <br>
         This system is similar to that of the human brain. <br>
         After we provide the hardware and advance software systems, AI will have to carry on the work by itself through <strong> evolution </strong>. <br> 
         That is where <strong> genetic algorithms </strong> come to play.
       </p>
       <h3 class ="post-small-title"> Genetic algorithms </h3>
       <p>
        Genetic algorithms work via <strong> survival of the fittest</strong>. A set of algorithms are created to solve a problem. <br>
        The most succesful ones are carried over to the next generation and crossed over to creat better versions of the algorithm. Eventually one of them is succesful in not only solving the problem but doing so in an <strong> optimal </strong> way. That will be the <strong> fittest</strong> algorithm.
       </p>
       <p> It's through technics like these that <strong> AGI </strong> will eventually develop into <strong> ASI</strong>. <br> <br>
